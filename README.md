## Project Setup
  Sorry for the delay with this project, I was late to receive it and have been
  working on it when possible. I'm to busy these days! Anyways, It is built using:
- _Backbone_
- _Underscore_
- _jQuery_
- _Skeleton CSS Library_

Featuring:

- _a simple PHP login_
- _localStorage_
- responsiveness ( I think it looks best on the iphone )_

I haven't had a chance for any rigorous smoke testing but for a quick build I'm quite 
happy with it. Please don't hesitate with input or feedback. Out of all the interviews
I took Estenda is my top runner. I hope you like it.
Regards,
Cody Hagg
